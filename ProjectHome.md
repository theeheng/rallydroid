# About Rallydroid #

Rallydroid interfaces with [Rally's Project Management](http://www.rallydev.com) software to allow you to access your project information on your Android-based device.

This project was developed by a Rally employee and user, as part of a hackathon (similar to Google's 20% time).

It's my first Android application, so I'm still learning my way around the API and I invite community feedback.

Rally does not officially endorse this application in any way.

At the present time, you have to check the source out and build it yourself.  Soon, I'd like to make a downloadable apk file available on the site as well as place the application in the Android Market for free.
